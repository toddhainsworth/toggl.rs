- Mocked API
  - Then we can send "requests" and check that we're sending the correct format
  - Basically take the example requests and responses from the API docs and match them
- Allow users to use &str's...lifetimes and all those goodies
- Unit-testing
- Some sort of universal fetcher to get rid of the association duplication
  - (eg. Workspace::projects implementation is duplicated _everywhere_)
  - PRIOTIISE THIS
